# EventSystem
This is a custom Scriptable object based, Observer pattern Event System for Unity based on Ryan Hipple's talk from Unite Austin 2017. 
The system aims at maintaining a decoupled system of Events that exist as scriptable objects so as to maintain discreetness between multiple Game Objects and Components.
